# Overview

This project is a simple random number generator app made for Android. The user can select between a few preset "dice" and it outputs a random number within that specification.

I made this app to learn more about Kotlin and front end development. I also learned more XML and Android Studio, which was very similar to an IDE that I already knew (IntelliJ IDEA), but was much more interconnected with other tools.

# Future Work

* Add animation to buttons and screens for a more organic feel
* Add ability to swipe between screens (using MultiPager)
* Make game profiles that saves the roles of each individual player
* Make a file saving system that all activities can pull from, so page-swapping is easier and history is saved
* Add more dice
* Animate actual dice rolling rather than just a number and loading circle
* Add light sensor and sound sensor, dynamically change probability based on these inputs in order to rig the game
